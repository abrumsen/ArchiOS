# ArchiOS

**ArchiOS** is a fork of [StealYourCode's repository](https://github.com/StealYourCode/ArchOs) that contains my take on the Operating systems architecture labs given by DE FOOZ Pierre at HEPL.

## Overview
This repository simplifies the Gentoo Linux installation process by providing automated scripts for tasks like disk partitioning, driver installation, and system setup.

### Pre-requisites
Before using the scripts, ensure the following:

- You have access to a live Gentoo environment (such as a VM or a physical machine with a Gentoo live CD).
- You have a stable internet connection.

> **Note: Review each script before running them to ensure they align with your disk setup and system configuration.**
